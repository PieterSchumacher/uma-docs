# Verification System

### Prerequisites&#x20;

Before getting into the specifics of how to verify proposals from the Optimistic Oracle, please make sure to go through the following resources to understand how UMA works:

* [Understanding UMA](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/oracle)
* [Understanding oSnap](https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/osnap)

### **Why Verification Matters:**

When a project integrates with UMA, they do so with the understanding that someone is always watching for the opportunity to dispute bad proposals. The Verification Team is one form of defence against these bad proposals, and an important one at that. This team is responsible for bringing the human element to proposal resolution. Sometimes the truth can only be discovered through intensive research and lengthy discussion. Our job is to highlight those moments and provide the best source of truth available for UMA voters to consider. By joining our team, you become a key contributor to our shared goal of maintaining the integrity of our oracle.
