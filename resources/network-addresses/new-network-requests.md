# New Network Requests

The following are the evaluation criteria UMA considers when adding Optimistic Oracle support for a new network. UMA aims to support as many networks as possible to deliver the best experience for our integrating protocols and users. However, integrating a new network requires a significant investment. Therefore, the evaluation criteria were established to ensure that the benefits to UMA's integrating protocols and users outweigh the development, security, and operational costs of adding a new network.

Please note that these requirements are subject to change as the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and Layer 2 ecosystem continue to evolve. Meeting these requirements is the initial step in our evaluation process and does not guarantee support.

* Availability of token mappings data source with Ethereum mainnet
