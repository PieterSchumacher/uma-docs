# ðŸ“¦ Migrate to oSnap Safe App

The most recent version of oSnap, also referred to as the oSnap Safe App, was launched on December 4, 2023. This new version enables smoother onboarding while maintaining the familiar user experience you already know.

If you installed oSnap before December 4, 2023, you are likely using the Gnosis SafeSnap version. We recommend migrating to the oSnap Safe App, as it is actively maintained by UMA.

To migrate, navigate to your Snapshot space, click **'Settings'** then '**Advanced'** on the left sidebar.
