This section showcases oSnap, which lets members of a DAO execute the results of any given Snapshot vote via a Safe with validation by UMA. This is made possible by having a published set of rules and public information secured by UMAâ€™s optimistic oracle.

The process of integrating oSnap includes:

* [Deployment tutorial](osnap-deployment-tutorial.md) using the Zodiac module
* [Snapshot tutorial ](snapshot-tutorial.md)to configure and execute transactions with Snapshot proposals
* An overview on [verifying and disputing](osnap-proposal-verification.md) proposed transactions
* Updating the oSnap using [admin functions](osnap-module-admin-functions.md)

Start the integration now using our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/osnap/osnap-quick-start) or [chat with the team](https://airtable.com/shrW1iJRbU4tEI9go) for more info.
