‚ÄúoSnap‚Äù is short for Optimistic Snapshot Execution.&#x20;

oSnap lets DAOs propose transactions, do an off-chain governance vote, and have the transaction data submitted in a trustless fashion.

What you need to get started

* Snapshot Space
* Safe with multi-sig (or Safe with on-chain governance)

Here are the step-by-step instructions for using oSnap.

* Create a Safe and Snapshot Space, or connect to your current accounts.&#x20;
* Go to Safe Apps, install the Zodiac app, and install the oSnap module through Zodiac.
* Set the proposal bond, challenge period, and Snapshot Space.
* Link the oSnap module to your Snapshot Space with SafeSnap.
* Your oSnap module address is added to the SafeSnap plugin configuration to enforce the results of proposals on-chain.

Done! Now, for your first proposal:

* Create a proposal and Snapshot vote, along with the transactions to execute if the proposal passes.
* Invite the community to vote on the proposal.
* Once the Snapshot voting period ends, anyone can propose the transactions by posting a bond.
* After the challenge period, execute the transactions on-chain through the Snapshot interface.

You can start using oSnap today and announce to your DAO the good news of its newfound superpowers.
